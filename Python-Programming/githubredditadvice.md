# Github Career Advice from Reddit Comment

I've had four interviews and two of them have specifically mentioned my github for why they were impressed. (it's not a scientific study, but it has helped me)

**Push almost everything, have a repo called "Practice" or something that makes it clear it's garbage and push your learning there, anything you don't want people to judge you on, put it there.** A long git history of lots of green (if you're thinking of job hunting or currently job hunting, try and make 5-6 a week be green).

**Include a Readme for EVERY repo.**  **Don't forget to add a screenshot** Make a basic template, I use <ins>this one</ins>. I make a section for "What it is" "Why I built it" "What I learned" "what mistakes I made" and I have a running list of what I'm building and what's to come for any project not finished. It's super easy to set up and once it's set up, you're mostly copying and pasting and changing the titles and a couple lines here and there.

**Star other people's repos if they are interesting. Fork a couple and build or alter something in them if you can.** Follow industry 'leaders' and those you use to learn. Make your github look active, HR loves it and it makes people think you're active and dedicated to the craft.
