# Mnemonic Project Notes

Feb 8, 2022

Started out trying to get a python interface using `tkinter` and it wasn't working out.

GUIs are hard. Next time try doing PySimpleGUI, it is much better documented. Tk is 30 years old!

Going to try and do this through the command line now.

Perhaps I need to find another Python book of projects? The small python projects book is a little too simple.
