# Three Things Never To Do When STudying Math
From the Math Sorcerer:

1. Study in a noisy place
2. Study with the computer/phone on
3. STudy without a plan.

As for #1, I basically already do that, except sometimes I will listen to classical. Maybe it is time to switch to pure white noise.

Number 2: I must use a computer since I have PDF copies of my books. God, I wish I could get English books easier in China! The used copies go for hundreds of Kuai, even for textbooks that would be 5 dollars in the US. Must make do with the computer for now

3. Lately I have been studying without a preset time limit, and without a very rigid plan. This is something I can improve on.
