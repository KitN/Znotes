A good smattering here.

## From Hitchhiker's Guide 2 Python
**The Python Tutorial**
This is Python’s official tutorial. It covers all the basics and offers a tour of the
language and the Standard Library. Recommended for those who need a quick-start guide to the language.

**Python for You and Me**
This book is an excellent resource for learning all aspects of the language and is good for _those who prefer learning from a traditional book rather than a tutorial._

**Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist**
This book attempts to give an introduction to basic concepts in computer science through the use of the Python language. The focus was to create a book with plenty of exercises, minimal jargon, and a section in each chapter devoted to debugging. It explores the various features available in the Python language and weaves in various design patterns and best practices.
The book also includes several case studies which have the reader explore the
topics discussed in the book in greater detail by applying those topics to real-
world examples. Case studies include designing a GUI and Markov Analysis.

**Python Koans**
This online tutorial is a Python version of Edgecase’s popular Ruby Koans. It’s an interactive command-line tutorial teaching basic Python concepts using a test-driven approach: by fixing assertion statements that fail in a test script, the stu‐dent progresses in sequential steps to learning Python.
For those accustomed to languages and figuring out puzzles on their own, this
can be a fun, attractive option. For those new to Python and programming, hav‐ing an additional resource or reference will be helpful.
