## Notes
Most design work happens in tools (Photoshop, Maya) where you manipulate objects directly and the program figures out how to communicate with the GPU mathematically.

In shadertoy, you explicitly declare the math and try to imply the forms you wish to see.

After enough time _freely playing_ the math functions become second nature

tweaking: "Can I _hit_ the look of this shape (e.g. palm tree)"

using known tricks vs. fortuitous accidents
