# Learning Programming Beside Calculus
I've been studying the book _Thomas' Calculus_. I would like to use my computer instead of a graphing calculator to experiment with graphs and functions etc.

There are many options (overwhelmingly many) for this. The best one is probably Mathematica or Matlab, but those are expensive flagship softwares.

I will learn to use Python

## Python Libraries for Math and Science
NumPy
SciPy
MatPlotLib
Jupyter?
