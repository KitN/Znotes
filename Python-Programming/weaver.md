# Project: Weaver
Make a visual representation of weaving (warp and weft)

## Sub-projects
### Get a grip on Processing for viz
Do some tutorials
Maybe a book? (lol make sure you aren't procrastinating)
Look at examples of good processing stuff
### Represent a simple weave
- represent a single thread of weft
- represent the warp without edges
- represent the shuttle
- implement step-through weaving, unweaving
    - pick by pick, level by leve
- implement different thread widths, coarsenesses
### Learn the basics of weaving terminology
a crafstman's guide would be helpful
### Are there libraries for topology?
What math papers and textbooks exist to help you on this
