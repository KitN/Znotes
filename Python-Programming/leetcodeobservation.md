## Ovservation
I am trying to solve leetcode problems before I have really studied these concepts. The leetcode website is not good for studying algorithms and data structures; trying to solve problems without any background is like trying to reinvent the wheel. 

I ought to return to leetcode after doing some formal study of algorithms. Some more nuts and bolts programming practice (or should that be 'bread and butter'?) will help me to crank through them. Currently, I am getting bogged down on certain problems unneccesarily.
