There's something fascinating in the infinite scroll. It's like a baby's mobile. Horsey, star, fishey, moon, horsey, star... Observe the baby's glee at the minor variations on the established pattern, the very recognition of the pattern. The trick will fade, childish toys will be stowed away. Yet we will not notice the return of the farce as a tragedy. To use such ancient terms, the ones used by Aeschlus in the Amphitheatre sounds absurdly pompous, but the language provides few better options. To employ the word 'tragic' in a campy way is okay, or for a mass shooting or distant tsunami.

Could one speak of the little tragedy of an imagination being salted? Millions of young people, tempted by the pornographers and the pimps. Their greatest victims are the women, mostly women, who they strip bare and flay, put the skin in the clouds, the saplings below deluded by agent orange, the color of the PornHub, the center of the wheel.
