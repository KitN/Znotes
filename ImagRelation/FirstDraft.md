If you went to a high school that feeds into college then you probably had a debate team. If you were a dork who read the newspaper and enjoyed wearing a tie then you were probably on that team. Those readers who were not quite so nerdy will surely need a bit of background info. Debate teams are extracurriculars; they are similar to school athletics – having local, regional, national and international levels of competition. Debating is one item in the full list of college-application accelerants for sale to schools and parents: business competitions, robotics competitions, model U.N. competitions and tudent research journals, to name a few. ‘Debating’ with a capital D is something of a widespread phenomenon: we think of Plato,  presidents and uncles in pubs.  High-school debating is not so general, being a set of social practices and events for teachers and children that came from U.S. public schools. Althusser said that education had replaced the church as the dominant ideological state apparatus. When we observe the elite instruction of high-school debate teams, we are witnessing the apparatus of education operating in its highest gear and  at its greatest efficiency. If teaching the youth about rhetoric and logic – how to think – is something worth doing, then it is worth doing well. I’m convinced high-school does quite the opposite, instead teaching the most literate and oratorical of students how to be intellectual mercenaries and moral relativists. 

  

\[Note to Ed:\]

\[Quoting from Althusser:\]

\[in fact, the Church has been replaced today in its role as the dominant Ideological State Apparatus by the school. It is coupled with the family just as the Church was once coupled with the family. We can now claim that the unprecedentedly deep crisis which is now shaking the education system of so many states across the globe, often in conjunction with a crisis (already proclaimed in the Communist Manifesto) shaking the family system, takes on a political meaning, given that the school (and the school–family couple) constitutes the dominant Ideological State Apparatus, the apparatus playing a determinant part in the reproduction of the relations of production of a mode of production threatened in its existence by the world class struggle.\]

  

<ins>\[when Althusser mentions the crisis shaking the education system, what does he mean? What became of this crisis? Has it been resolved, or evolved? It seems  (capitalist) education has, like capitalism, been in crisis from day one\]</ins>

  

Everyone involved with high-school debating explicitly understands it is a stepping-stone to colleges and  subsequent careers. The National Speech & Debate Association (NSDA), the largest organization of its kind, markets their organization with this data:

  

\[pic here: the graphic summarizes research about the trajectories of debaters after school

90% have one graduate degree, 15% are corporate execs, 30% are university educators, 10% work in the government\]

  
  
  

For the preppy, silver-tongued kids who get into debating, futures as lawyers, legislators and professors will not depend on whether they play tennis or water polo, join the debate team or the model U.N; many of these children will, by virtue of their class and talents, slot right in as long as nothing major goes awry. High-school debate is still a training ground for the culture of power, though. It teaches ideological lessons that are necessary for becoming a judge, pundit or CIA agent. Moving up in class, or simply keeping a grip on the elevated position you start with, will depend on your ability to learn the varied skills, postures, beliefs and tastes of the ‘white collar’; in a word, social mobility depends on transforming oneself (allowing oneself to be transformed) into a subject of appropriate ideology. What particular ideological practices does the debate phenomenon reinforce, and how?

  
Student debating varies from region to region and from format to format. The commonwealth nations mimic houses of parliament, whereas the ‘Lincoln-Douglas’ format is practiced in the US. In any case, the phenomenon has an essential unity: students can participate in several formats, graduate into more senior leagues and so forth. The different speeches students give in each of provinces have a family resemblance. A couple of case studies will be illustrative.

  

First, consider the contest I found on Youtube, titled ‘Intelligence – High School Debate’ \[[<ins>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMEwVXv2aQc</ins>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMEwVXv2aQc)\] and presented by Arirang TV, a South Korean public broadcaster that produces English content for foreign viewers. This glossy production features a host, three adult judges, eight high-school aged competitors and a studio audience of 50 other high schoolers. The adult judges include a (white) English professor, a Korean law professor and a former Japanese English-debate champion.

  

This show has some high production values, and surely these kids are the cream of the crop, but the format is pretty typical. A ‘resolution’ for debate is decided upon in advance by the event’s organizers: “This House believes that governments should provide a guaranteed Universal Basic Income”. Which team debates in favor of the resolution, and which against, is decided by coin flip;  in our video, students draw embossed leather scrolls for the camera.

  

\[pic here of drawing the scroll\]

  

This pre-written resolution is already circumscribed by liberal ideology: it is an abstract, general ‘should’ statement, the kind television talking heads would bat around and perhaps even endorse or reject, depending on ideological stripe. It’s not unlike teaching children creative writing and saying “write a story that begins ‘she doesn’t like salad’ and references a comb and a lemur.”. Any good-faith engagement with these issues on the part of the students is further impeded by the ‘coin-flip’ custom. Students are discouraged from forming their own opinions in order to ‘raise the level’ of their debate. Instead, they have weeks (or minutes, in some formats) to research both sides of their argument. Naive students, as I once was, approach debate with images of historic parliaments and classical groves – the major leagues; they have genuine desire to push the limits of their abilities. It can be disheartening when they discover that they will, in effect, be playing t-ball. When the adults set the the resolutions,  then the possible arguments and sources of research are basically predetermined

  

The effect of all this is clear in the content and delivery of the students speeches. The first girl to speak delivers a five minute speech in favor of UBI. She claims that Finland has attempted this and that the model is ‘gaining support’; a UBI program ‘alleviates economic inequality’  and is supported by Milton Friedman and Friedrech Hayek, names which her adversaries and audience perhaps don’t even know. Next, she forwards another claim that was surely farmed from some op-ed or other: UBI gives the government room to cut other social spending.

  

The first debater gives a laudable public oration for someone so young, all the more so since English is her second language. She is playing to win --yet I feel that she does not speak from conviction. If, by luck of the draw, she stood on the other side of the room, she would surely be giving opposite arguments with the same gusto. The same is true for the other seven students who come up to the microphone and cover all of the usual talking points, pro and con, for this issue. The final speaker, an eloquent boy who speaks more passionately than those who have come before, gives the last speech against UBI. He cites the 20th century ‘failure’ of communism, and quips a phrase straight off the front page of The Sun (he admits to literally citing some article or other for this). The boy calls Helsinki ‘Hellsinking’ for the disastrous effects of their UBI experiment. Nevermind that the two thousand person experiment done in Finland was far from a hellish disaster; The truth value of these arguments doesn’t matter because this is a game. The kid has been well coached. If he had flipped heads and not tails, would he be singing Finland’s praises? The boy receives a high ‘audience score’ and the judges award victory to the con side, specifically lauding the final speaker. Win this game, and you will be praised by teachers, parents and the media – perhaps the doors of your dream college will open to you.

  

In the next example, the same issues of arbitrariness of topic and stance appear. On top of that, the talismanic worship of ‘evidence’ is on display. You will find “2019 NSDA Lincoln-Douglas Debate Finals” on Youtube; \[[<ins>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyyjm2PO5qY&t</ins>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyyjm2PO5qY&t)\] it is a full recording of the final round of the National Speech and Debate Association’s ultimate U.S. tournament in the Lincoln-Douglas category, named after the famous presidential debate \[Those debates might be the birthplace of this whole beast; they are early examples of ‘mass media’ debates, but I don’t have the historical background to really comment on that\]. Here we have a one on one debate between two high-schoolers over the claim that “violent revolution is a just response to political oppression”.  I tend to agree with this statement, yet is is so general as to make assent or dissent meaningless. In the hegemonic culture of the Anglosphere, Cuba was a ‘violent revolution’ but the overthrow of Gaddafi was a  part of the ‘Arab Spring’.  As in the last case, the ‘adults in the room’ pitched this topic for the final round. Students are randomly assigned to the affirmative or negative then given time to prepare their arguments. Since the tournaments operate in the normal, sporting way – head-to-head matches, winner advances to the next bracket -- organizers attempt to pick topics which will not unfairly hamper one side or the other (Resolved: Hitler was a good guy, actually.) How this balancing act is accomplished is a crucial point. Perhaps the judges intuit the general liberal consensus, the middle-ground which is safe and acceptable to fight over. I wish I could be a fly on the wall of the room where they pitch these ideas. If a student tries to move the topic of debate too far from the preset they will surely be stubbing their own toe. I cannot imagine a competitor at this high-level attempting to discuss, say, the ontology of violence, the relationship of the nation to the state, or the U.S. history of propping or crushing revolutions according to its whims. That would surely be a poor tactical choice. Steering the debate off topic, far away from the expected content, will surely win the ire of judges and audience.

  

What actually occurs is a debate that will enrich the careers of these young people while salting their intellect. Both students launch into their big-stage speeches with the same energy they would bring if they had been given the other side of the argument. They rattle off a dozen citations of researchers that no one present can have read or be prepared to seriously content with. This teaches the students to value evidence as little more than props: scrape them up from the internet into your bag of tricks, and don’t be too choosy; no one present will be able to tell the good from bad. I have transcribed one interesting exchange, during one of the cross-examination portions where students are allowed to directly question and answer eachother.

  

\-\-\-

  

Con. Revolution: Can you specifically cite an example of a government that's formed recently from violent revolution that doesn't perpetuate more oppression?

  

Pro. Revolution: Right so I think there are a couple problems with your analysis. First of all, we can never definitively say that one variable will cause a more oppressive government or a less oppressive government. In fact per Worski ‘12, a meta study conducted from Duke University concluded that in the body of available political science, in the body of available statistics, it's impossible to come to a definitive statistical conclusion that one variable will lead to a better government...

  

Con: Revolution: Okay, that's not my question I'm asking you for an example of a violent revolution that didn't perpetuate oppression…

  

Pro. Revolution: Right I can give you better than examples I can provide you with an empirical study of past historical examples which says that non-violence does contribute to not well 

  

Con. Revolution: you have any of those examples available?

  

Pro. Rev: I mean I can provide you with the empirical study

  

Con. Rev: okay that's fine.

  

\[here the speaker tacks and abandons the previous inquiry. The two cannot have a dialogue about the results of previous revolutions. Their necessity to win demands that they be dogmatic, to find fault with their opponent. Time is also limited, getting snagged on historical fact is not tactically sound. Similarly, evaluating the quality of the paper the boy cites is impossible in this format, which only allows for slim paraphrase and appeals to authority \]

  

 if revolutions lead to government that don't actually reflect the oppressed is that a successful one?

Pro. Rev: I think insofar as it's gotten rid of the existing structural oppression, yes. we should worry about overthrowing the government first then worry about creating a new governments

\[the time here has run out in this portion of the debate\]

  

I think the very format and coaching they receive drives these otherwise very intelligent young people into the type of wrangling argument Plato ridiculed the Sophists for, what he called ‘eristics’. These two clever, ambitious young people have been assigned a case to make and a prize to win. They rally their forces: They speak quickly and eloquently, chanting citations - Kim 2009, Chenoweth 2016; they seize on gaps in their opponents arguments while waving away counterarguments; They invoke abstract moral principles and make moral claims formally divorced from their own beliefs.

  

The other dialogues and monologues are predictable. Try to imagine what they will say before you skim the video. Given a topic for debate, the pro and con cases write themselves. The real contest is to see which students have the concentration and wit enough to play their pre-determined parts, dressed with whatever citations they can find from legit-sounding sources. Presumably, a competitor could even ‘invent’ an author and paper (LeBowski 2001 performed a meta-analysis that showed women and children were harmed in 89% of political turmoil). I’d wager money that this is already fairly common in the less public rounds.

  

Perhaps I am being too cynical. Isn’t it natural to start the young ones with training wheels, with T-ball? The kids have fun, make friends and learn to ‘think on their feet’ in the words of the old cliché. I know I found it exciting, as a teen, to anticipate the coin-flip: come what may, I had to sell my case and seek victory.  As a teacher and coach, however, I only lasted one tournament. My two teams were novices in the Chinese English-language league. We debated whether public college in the U.S. should be tuition free. I taught them the rules and the forms; helped spoonfeed them the ‘research package’ prepared by the league, sourced from the publications of think tanks and the pages of The Atlantic. The stricture to debate ‘both sides’ is explained as a way to teach logic and rhetoric seperately from content, and a way to broaden the views of students who might otherwise enter these discussions on prejudice alone. In practice, I found that this stifles any sincere investigation into the issues at hand. I once had a team debating in favor of free tuition. One of my students, let’s call her Mandy, made what I thought was an interesting point during a live debate, one that she had raised in our  open-ended discussion of the topic. Her point was not a point of fact, but one of morality. I cannot recall the details, but I taught her that, if we accepted the premise of her argument, the conclusions surely followed. She attempted to deploy this argument in the debate. Her opponent, clearly an old hand, sensed an opening requested a ‘source for that’.  Never mind that no ‘evidence’ was possible for the rather elemental moral claim made by my student. Her team lost. The ‘citizen’ judge wagged her finger: supporting your claims with evidence is important. Mandy was visibly crestfallen. She had brought her own reasoning and beliefs to the debate and was quickly punished for it. \[I really wish I could remember the details of the argument in question, but it has slipped my memory. As far as I recall, the point had pushed the terms of the debate a little too far outside of the liberal givens\] Shortly after, I resigned as coach. I felt that teaching them well was incompatible with teaching them to win.

  
  

\[I’m really not sure how to conclude this here\]

  

Antonio Gramsci once observed the contradiction:

“””

In fact between liceo and university, i.e. between the school properly speaking and life, there is now a jump, a real break in continuity, and not a rational passage from quantity (age) to quality (intellectual and moral maturity). From an almost purely dogmatic education, in which learning by heart plays a great part, the pupil passes to the creative phase, the phase of autonomous,

p.32

independent work. From the school, where his studies are subjected to a discipline that is imposed and controlled by authority, the pupil passes on to a phase of study or of professional work in which intellectual self-discipline and moral independence are theoretically unlimited. And this happens immediately after the crisis of puberty, when the ardour of the instinctive and elementary passions has not yet resolved its struggle with the fetters of the character and of moral conscience which are in the process of being formed. Moreover, in Italy, where the principle of 'seminar' work is not widespread in the universities, this passage is even more brusque and mechanical .”””

  

This is great stuff!  It would be a great addition to the “ideology of education” issue we are working on for later this summer.  My main suggestion is to add more examples from you personal experience—either as a debater or as a coach.
