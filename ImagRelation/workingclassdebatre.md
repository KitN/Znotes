# An apology to my coach

I'm sorry I wasn't a very reliable team president. I know I was the only person really qualified but I didn't want the job. I knew I wouldn't be able to do what you needed me to do and that there were far better ways to disperse that responsibility among the team.

I'm sorry I was never able to stay after school to help the novices, I work 2 jobs and I just didn't have the time. I gave them all my number and told them I would get back to them as soon as I could but I guess it wasn't enough.

I'm sorry I always showed up to tournaments in a hoodie and sweatpants, I didn't have the money for any nice clothes.

I'm sorry that I was always a little late my first 3 years, I had to walk to all of our tournaments that the school didn't get us to because I couldn't drive and I couldn't afford to Uber.

I'm sorry sometimes I was a little dirty, I got kicked out of my house a lot so sometimes I slept under that bridge by the school or in my car when I couldn't find a place to stay.

I'm sorry sometimes I would cancel going to tournaments less than a week before. Getting to and from, managing my work schedule and finding someone to watch my brothers was a logistical nightmare. In the same vein, I'm sorry I couldn't ever go to tournaments that weren't in Houston. No state, UIL, nats, ToC or whatever. And that I couldn't go to camp, even when the school offered to pay. There was just no way I could have done that, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry I broke down crying in between rounds one day. I didn't know how to tell my little brothers that their mom was going back to rehab, and that at the rate I was going I would be next. I couldn't tell anybody that I had an addiction, and I didn't know what to do. I was scared and it all just hit me at once. My bad

I'm sorry I called that PF debater an arrogant prick, but he used the drug topic as an excuse to frame drug users as subhuman.

I'm sorry I didn't ever read right wing bullshit in round and read anticapitalist stuff instead. Reading Marx was the first time I really felt like maybe my problems weren't my fault and that maybe there was a way out.

Sorry I ditched class for a whole week my junior year. I promise I wasn't having fun, I was going through oxycodone withdrawal. Don't worry though, I picked up a coke habit to compensate. Sorry I just completely ditched a round. I did a lot of k and got holed in the bathroom accidentally.

I'm sorry that your best debater didn't view debate as a "fun activity" "educational" or whatever. It was something that would maybe get me into a good college and a good career where I might actually have a chance of not being fucking poor for once. And it DID get me into a good college. A really good college actually. But it wasn't enough to get me a full ride so trade school it is.

I don't expect a handout and I don't mean to sound ungrateful. You don't need to pander to me, but you didn't need to yell at me in front of the whole team. Why did those girls have to defend me? They can't know more about what I go through every day than you do. You as a teacher have to at least have an idea of what's going on, right? I never told you the full story and maybe I should have, but you couldn't have just not noticed that something was up. Did you not think it was weird that I was always the one taking care of my siblings? That I worked from 4-11 on weekdays as a sophomore? That I would ask for your help filling out papers my parents should have been doing? It didn't ring any alarm bells that I carry my ss card, birth certificate etc. in a folder in my car? I love debate but it feels like every tournament I've gone to has been an uphill battle. I worked so hard for you and my team but you always expected me to be able to do shit that I just couldn't do. Maybe you thought you were pushing me to be better but I was just trying to get through the day.

Sorry for the rant I just needed to put this out somewhere and I don't really know where this would be appropriate
