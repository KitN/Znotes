## Tom asks: How can we know the acceptable arguments and sources? How are they predetermined?

Whichever will work on the judges: The students anticipate, or learn from experience, which kinds of arguments and sources are likely to win. No matter the country, language or particular flavor, it's a pyramid, a competitive sport. It's not unlike the other 'sports'. Eventually, the children and families who are not truly talented or committed will be weeded out by the pressure of competition. At least in team sports.
The judges are picked from the adult population in a haphazard way: any school-teacher who is persuaded to chaperone; grandparents who can take the day off to listen to debates, etc. Mostly, the adults who already have established relationships to the students in question

## The students must be prepared to give arguments for both sides with equal gusto.
Tom asks: _This is a key point. What kind of subjects does this make these students into?_

From my own experience, I was never able to evaluate my own performance, except by the standards given by the competitions themselves: winning or losing.


## Sources allowable:
Any published research at all. Research from think tanks. Because of the apparently 'topical' nature of questions, recent writing is favored heavily over older writing. To quote Marx, Freud or Noam Chomsky on any matter is a gamble: the judges in the room will perhaps already have opinions on these people. Much safer, then, to quote **Stubbs, Thomas (Dept. of Politics & International Relations, U. of London)** writing in "WORLD DEVELOPMENT", when he claims that the changes the IMF made to help 'developing' countries deal with COVID are 'underwhelming'. 

Obscure vs. Known

External vs. Internal

Recent vs. Old

Breadth vs Depth

Uncritical vs. Critical

Consider: **Resolved: The benefits of the International Monetary Fund outweigh the harms**

Observe the highly-upvoted cheat-sheet

The concept of **evidence** is flattened into a talisman.

## New point: To advance to higher levels, schools or parents need money.

## It's fundamentally about persuasion; truth and falsity are completely tangential.

## Loose Notes

There are no judges for the judges

PRIORITY 4: PROMOTE EFFICIENCY IN DEBT NEGOTIATIONS WITH PRIVATE CREDITORS

Over recent decades, the IMF has played a key role in promoting a collaborative and efficient participation of private creditors in debt restructurings. Part of that role involves promoting the standardization of collective action clauses (CACs) in debt contracts to limit the ability of litigating creditors to block a restructuring

Masters, Jonathan ( leads writers and editors who produce wide-ranging content for CFR.org, including Backgrounders, visual stories, and events. He also writes on foreign policy and national security and his work has appeared in Foreign Affairs, the Atlantic, and Bloomberg.) “The IMF: The World’s Controversial Financial Firefighter” CFR, Aug 2020 [<ins>https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/imf-worlds-controversial-financial-firefighter</ins>](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/imf-worlds-controversial-financial-firefighter)

The IMF is routinely identified with economic hardship and political ferment because it is only in times of crisis that its services are sought. It is often the only organization equipped for such interventions, and evaluating the fund’s success over the past seventy-plus years is a difficult task. As Harvard economist Benjamin M. Friedman has argued, “We cannot reliably know whether the consequences of the IMF’s policies were worse than whatever the alternative would have been.”
