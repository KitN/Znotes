## Rough notes general thoughts
 Intro
 
 >  **Deep Work:** Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.
  
 > **Shallow Work:** Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.
 
 _The Shallows_ was just the first in a series of recent books to examine the Internet’s effect on our brains and work habits.
 
 _The Pragmatic Programmer_, a well-regarded book in the computer programming field, makes this connection between code and old-style craftsmanship more directly by quoting the medieval quarry worker’s creed in its preface: “We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals.” The book then elaborates that computer programmers must see their work in the same way:

>>_Within the overall structure of a project there is always room for individuality and craftsmanship… One hundred years from now, our engineering may seem as archaic as the techniques used by medieval cathedral builders seem to today’s civil engineers, while our craftsmanship will still be honored._
   
   
## Action notes
From Part II
### Work Deeply
There are different levels of depth, from monastic to quite scattered. I probably need to be more monastic, considering my foibles. This will take some career changes

#### Ritualize
**You need a ritual**
1. Where will you work and for how long?
2. How you will work once you start?
3. Supporting activities (the logistics of the army)

Make grand gestures, like Rowling renting a fucking hotel room…

Hub-and-spoke model for collaboration
    - You need a spoke where you can be free from distraction
    - but, you also want to leverage the whiteboard effect
    
#### Disciplines for execution
The strategy (form) is easy to come up with, but we need a strategy for the strategy; a way to follow through.
##### Discipline 1: Focus on the wildly important
     > If you want to win the war for attention, don’t try to say ‘no’ to the trivial distractions you find on the information smorgasbord; t_ry to say ‘yes’ to the subject that arouses a terrifying longing, and let the terrifying longing crowd out everything else_.”_ry to say ‘yes’ to the subject that arouses a terrifying longing, and let the terrifying longing crowd out everything else_
     so you need ambitious goals!
##### Discipline 2: Act on the lead measures
   Some measures of sucess are only visible after you have already accomplished it: lag measures
   Focus on the converse, lead measures:
       time spent working, building cred
##### Discipline 3: KEep a compelling Scoreboard
Try counting the hours of deep work you get on a highly visible scorecard
Habitica also kind of works like this (kind of...)

 ##### Discipline 4: Create a cadence of accountability
**Make a weekly review**

#### Be Lazy: The use of off-time
Have a clear end to your workday
    _this is more feasible when I am on sabbatical/already a knowledge worker_
##### Downtime aids insights
##### Downtime helps recharge
##### The evening is chill anyways
You won't get your best work down once you have exhausted your daily max. Make sure you chill in the evenings.

Consider a shutdown ritual, so you don't spend too much time worrying at night.


### Embrace Boredom
>getting the most out of your deep work habit requires training, and as clarified previously, this training must address two goals: improving your ability to concentrate intensely _and_overcoming your desire for distraction.

#### Take break from focus, not breaks from distraction
AKA Schedule internet use (or podcasts, in my case.. etc.)
##### Doesn't matter if your job needs replies
##### BE STRICT! don't cave when you are in the no-net zone
##### Schedule _leisure_ internet use too.

#### Give yourself a deadline to force intensity
This uses your limited deep work time and preserves the 'free' time in your life.

####  Meditate Productively
   Basically just samadhi, but with an intellectual focus. The kind of thing Tom Pepper advocates
 Use time during your walks for this, waiting for the bus 
 
 ##### Be ware of distractions and looping
 Don't let yourself get off track or stuck in a loop. Like mindfulness meditation, return to the 'breath
 
 ##### Structure your thinking
 Try not to be totally loosey goosey during these sessions. Have set points, fixed stars …
 
#### Memorize a Deck of Cards
Cognitive training
Can use mental math too 
 
 
 
### Quit Social Media
> **The Any-Benefit Approach to Network Tool Selection:** You’re justified in using a network tool if you can identify _any_ possible benefit to its use, or _anything_ you might possibly miss out on if you don’t use it.
WRONG

> **The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection:** Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts.
RIGHT

Similar to what 4000 weeks book argues

#### Apply the law of the vital few
Only use the MOST IMPORTANT digital tools
Do I really need to be on the rhizzone and element?
Do I really need to read Naked Capitalism?

#### Quit Social Media
I basically already have
Don't start! **reddit is creeping in at the moment...**

#### Don't use the internet to entertain yourself

Good advice. Follow it.

_Put more thought into your leisure time. Be intentional about it_

Structured Hobbies

Actually, this vigorous way of living is not what makes you tired.
Living like a worm on a river does...
### Drain the Shallows

#### Schedule Every minute Of Your Day
Yikes, idk if I can do this one.

Reschedule if you have to.

##### Quantify the depth of every activity

##### Ask your boss for a shallow work budget

##### Finish your work by 5:30

##### Become hard to reach
I already am.

This section has many tips on avoiding wasting time on petty e-mails, but I don't have that problem.
I might one day though...
