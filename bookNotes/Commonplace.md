_Let us grant that the pursuit of mathematics is a divine madness of the
human spirit, a refuge from the goading urgency of contingent happenings.

From Cambridge introduction to Robert Frost

>As he wrote in a short preface 'the prerequsites':
>>A poem is best read in the light of all the other poems ever written. We read A the better to read B (we have to start somewhere; we may get very little out of A). We read B the better to read C, C the better to read D, D the better to go back and get something more out of A. Progress is not the aim, but circulation. The thing is to get among the poems, where they hold each other apart in their place as the stars do.
