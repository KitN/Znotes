## Notes
It is of course in the The Canterbury Tales that Chaucer most boldly
mixes and juxtaposes differing social voices and genres within a single po-
etic structure. Such promiscuous ambition, we have noted, is already scented
among ‘shipmen and pilgrimes’ at the end of the House of Fame (2122) and
more substantially explored in the Parliament of Fowls. But it is Boccaccio’s
example, it would seem, that finally encourages Chaucer to organize a trav-
elling company of tellers under a single narrative structure; fully one-quarter
of Chaucer’s tales find analogues in the Decameron.44
